## General information

This package contains a collection of hooks that [varheight](https://www.varheight.ch) uses in many of their projects.

Should you choose to use this package for any of your projects, we would love to hear from you and what you are building! Make sure to reach out to us either via our [contact form](https://www.varheight.ch/kontakt) or directly via [e-mail](mailto:hello@varheight.ch) if you don't speak GermanðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ (which we understand is very likely ðŸ˜‰).

## Contribution

While we are not actively looking for any contributers or help with this collection, we also do not prohibit you from participating. So if you found any bugs or want to contribute in any other way, feel free to open an Issue or PR and we will check it out as soon as we can.

Thanks a lot and happy coding!
